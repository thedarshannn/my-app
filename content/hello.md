## Welcome to My First Blog ✨

This is my first blog post! I’m excited to start sharing my thoughts, projects, and learnings here.

### Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a place where I could document:

- Web development experiments
- Portfolio design ideas
- Minimal and clean UI concepts
- Tips and tricks I discover while learning

### How This Blog is Built

- **Next.js** for fast and modern React-based websites
- **ShadCN UI** for beautiful, accessible, and reusable components
- **TailwindCSS** for styling with utility classes

### Goals

1. Keep it minimal and readable
2. Make content visually appealing without distractions
3. Provide real-world examples and tutorials

I hope you enjoy reading my blog! Stay tuned for more posts on web development, UI design, and personal projects.
