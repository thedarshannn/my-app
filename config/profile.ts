  bio: [
    "I'm an international student from India, now living in Canada. I recently graduated from Humber College in Computer Engineering Technology â€” and trust me, I know all about those late nights, coffee-fueled projects, and college grind life! â˜•ðŸ’»",

    "Right now, I'm leveling up my skills with IT certifications while also exploring entry-level opportunities in software development and IT support. I'm super curious, always learning, and love experimenting with new tech.",

    "One of my favorite projects was Smart Sprout, an IoT-based smart home garden system. I led the development team and delivered both the hardware system and Android app â€” all up and running smoothly in just 8 months. ðŸŒ±",

    "I've also built a fitness assistant using AI & computer vision and a greenhouse controller with Raspberry Pi, because I enjoy blending hardware + software to create useful, real-world solutions.",

    "Always up for a challenge, always building something new. ðŸš€",
